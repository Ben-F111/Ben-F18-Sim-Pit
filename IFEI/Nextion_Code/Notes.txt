Hi all

By no means am I an expert on the sim, or the details contained

The sim is part Open Hornets, Part self modified, Part PCB's by a 3rd party

You are welcome to use the files, share them whatever. I will do my best to assist

Screen is a Next ion 7" Enhanced NX8048K070 (NONE HDMI)

the code is part Arduino, Part DCS BIOS, all the outputs are not correct as there are missing gaps in DCS_Bios

There will be updates; the team do a fantastic job
